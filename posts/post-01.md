Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs quickly. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with pre-designed components, Tailwind CSS focuses on providing the building blocks to create unique designs without leaving your HTML.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

### 1. Flexibility

Tailwind CSS doesn't impose design decisions on you. Instead, it empowers you to create your own designs by composing utility classes together.

### 2. Maintainability

With Tailwind CSS, your HTML serves as the single source of truth for your styles. This makes it easier to maintain and refactor your codebase as your project grows.

### 3. Performance

Tailwind CSS allows you to create highly optimized stylesheets tailored to your project's needs. You only include the styles you use, leading to smaller file sizes and faster load times.

## How Tailwind CSS Works

### 1. Utility Classes

Tailwind CSS provides a vast array of utility classes that you can apply directly to your HTML elements. These classes handle everything from margins and padding to typography and colors.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
</button>
